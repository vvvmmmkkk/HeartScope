# 📊 Dataset Overview

### About the Dataset

This project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which focuses on ECG signal features for arrhythmia classification. The original dataset was derived from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset hosted on PhysioNet.

It contains features extracted from **two-lead ECG signals (lead II and lead V5)**, focusing on detecting cardiac arrhythmias. The dataset includes programmatically extracted features critical for distinguishing regular and irregular heartbeats.

## 🔗 Dataset Sources

The dataset includes features from four ECG arrhythmia datasets:

1. MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database - MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database.csv
2. MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database - MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.csv
3. St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database - INCART_Arrhythmia.csv
4. Sudden Cardiac Death Holter Database

we would be using the first 3 dataset for building the model

## 🎯 Target Column

The `type` column classifies heartbeats into:

- **N**: Normal beats
- **S**: Supraventricular ectopic beats
- **V**: Ventricular ectopic beats
- **F**: Fusion beats
- **Q**: Unknown beats
